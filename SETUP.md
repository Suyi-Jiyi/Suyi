# Suyiverse - Interactive Poetry Generator

A beautiful, meditative website where users enter a word in any language and receive a high-quality, original poem generated by Claude AI.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+) installed
- An Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/Suyi
npm install
```

2. **Set up your API key:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Running the Application

**In one terminal, start the backend server:**
```bash
npm start
```

You should see: `Suyiverse server running at http://localhost:3001`

**In another terminal (or same terminal after server starts), run the front-end server:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/Suyi
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Access the Website

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## How It Works

1. User enters a word (in any language)
2. Frontend sends the word to the backend at `localhost:3001`
3. Backend calls Claude API with a sophisticated prompt for poetic generation
4. Claude generates an original, high-quality poem
5. Poem is displayed beautifully on the page
6. Word garden refreshes with multilingual terms

## Features

- **Multilingual support**: Enter words in any language
- **High-quality poetry**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for sophisticated, original compositions
- **Real-time generation**: Instant poem creation with loading indicator
- **Responsive design**: Beautiful on desktop and mobile
- **Interactive word garden**: Dynamically refreshing collection of poetic terms

## Customization

Edit the prompt in `server.js` (the message content) to change the poetry style, length, or theme.
